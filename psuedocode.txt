    Create a UI interface using, PySide2, TKInter, SimplePyGUI, or other.
    Need a UI that is a table with three columns.
    Table needs to be able to have many, many, rows be added to if needed.
    Table will take each Row and covert it to a dictionary and append it to the List of data.
    So data will be a list of dictionaries
    Learn how to do this.



#     Create the backend program that does the math.
#     main_list = [{'Name': v,'acres': v,'NRI': v}, {'Name': v,'acres': v,'NRI': v}, {'Name': v,'acres': v,'NRI': v,}]
#     royalty_acres = [''
#     Each row will be stored as a dictionary with the column headers as the keys.
#     Take each row and append it to the main_list
#     for i(row) in main_list
#         roy_acre = 'NRI' key * 'acre key'
#         royalty_acres.append(i)
#         royalty_acres['roy_acres'] = roy_acre
