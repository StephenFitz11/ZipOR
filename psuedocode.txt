// Create the program.
    ZipOR will have a window pop up and ask the user to select their desktop folder.
    ZipOR will prompt the user and ask how many breaks they have
    ZipOR will create an excel workbook with the sheets based on how many breaks they have
    User will copy all breaks into the spreadsheet
    ZipOR will prompt them to close the spreadsheet once all data has been copied and
        parameters are met.
    ZipOR will run the math on each spreadsheet then return a NEW excel sheet output
    ZipOR will ask them if they would like to run another WI recap.
    ZipOR will cache all the data the user input to a cache which the user then can re run the same WB
        from a previous session if need be.
